Standardized temples: Quickly add geographic group labels and macroeconomic series to panel data. Supports **World Bank / UN** standardized classifications for research reproducibility.

**Core Scenarios**ÔºöCross-country panel time series analysis | Regional disparity comparison studies | International organization member country screening

  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The term **"country" (cnt)**Ôºåused interchangeably with **"economy"** in this project,  does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.

## üìå Notes

1. **ISO3 Format Requirement**ÔºöEnsure the country code in the original data conforms to the input type required by the script (recommended to use `iso3c` in `str3` format). 
2. **Time-varying Grouping**ÔºöFor groups with member country changes (e.g., EU), the `year` variable must explicitly indicate the time dimension.
